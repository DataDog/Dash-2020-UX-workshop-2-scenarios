# Move Fast Without Breaking Things
## Dash 2020 - UX Monitoring Workshops #2

With scale, any software system will eventually suffer from failures and regressions.
In this Workshop, we will see some strategies to ensure the quality of service despite this bitter reality.

To catch regressions, we will introduce end-to-end tests (Synthetics tests) and monitoring (RUM).
To catch them as early as possible, we will introduce Canary deployments and CI/CD tests.
