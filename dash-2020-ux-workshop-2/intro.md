# Move Fast Without Breaking Things
_Dash 2020 - UX Monitoring Workshops #2_

With scale, any software system will eventually suffer from failures and regressions.
In this Workshop, we will see some strategies to ensure the quality of service despite this bitter reality.

1. To trigger this regressions in a controlled way, we will introduce Canary deployments, Blue-green deployments as part of a Continous Delivery pipeline.  
2. To catch regressions, we will introduce end-to-end tests (Synthetics tests) and monitoring (RUM).  
3. And finally, to catch these regressions as early as possible, we will learn how to trigger these tests as part of our Continuous Integration pipeline.
