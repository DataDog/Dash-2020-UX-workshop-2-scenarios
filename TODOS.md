TODO
- post-merge might be pre-send or something to simulate the server deploying stuff, instead? Though pushing won't be possible.
- have different steps for staging and prod, with a different env var to have docker-compose push to different ports
- then activate hook for staging branch as well
- implement all the regressions
- implement the CI: have the hook send CI trigger request and wait for response

- Prepare fallback docker images in case everything breaks prior or during the workshop (e.g. dependencies mismatch).
