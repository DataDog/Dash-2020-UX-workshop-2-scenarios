# Move Fast Without Breaking Things
_Dash 2020 - UX Monitoring Workshops #2_

Congratulations, you just took a few steps toward safer deployments and a more stable infrastructure!

We hope you enjoyed this workshop, that it grew your interest in this subject and gave you the tools to dive deeper.

To summarize, and if you had to remember only a few things from this workshop, it would be these:

Things will break at scale, and there is no avoiding it.
- To **catch** these regressions, we can use **end-to-end testing**, Synthetics tests.
- To **contain** these regressions, we can deploy carefully with the **canary deployment strategy**, and
- To catch them **as early as possible**, we can use **CI/CD** to trigger tests before publishing the changes.

**failures are unavoidable, what is important is to minimize the impact for your users**
